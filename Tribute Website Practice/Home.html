                        Austin is a friend I met via my other good mate Moose back in Late Spring of 2022. We first met after I integrated back in the friend group and joined Connor's new Minecraft server. After a couple months, we had played many different games together including Minecraft and Valorant.

                      <p>
                          If I remember correctly, I met Connor back in 2021 when I was invited to join a Minecraft server he was hosting. At the time, I was in college and the pandemic was in full swing. I joined the server, where I met Connor and became close with him and some of his friends.

                      <h2>
                          Ghosty
                      </h2>
                      <p>
                          From what I can remember, I met Ghosty in early 2023. She had first encountered Moose and another friend of ours in a Valorant game, which led to her joining our Discord where we met. We became friends pretty fast and we started playing games together as a group. (Stardew Valley specifically)

                      <p>
                          With Grey, we met when he joined our Discord as a friend of Ghosty's. This was in April of 2023 I am pretty sure. We started hanging out and talking in Discord because we both enjoyed Valorant and Overwatch 2.

                    Keenan
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I met Keenan back in 2019 when I first started attending college. We met each other because we were both apart of our collegiate Rocket League team. At the time, I was a Freshman and he was a Junior I believe. Keenan and I have spent a lot of time playing Rocket League together.

                  <p>
                      Like Keenan, I met Matt back when I was attending college. We met at an esports event for the college, where we played with a pro esports team. Prior to him joining our school, we played a ton of Rocket League 6-mans. Me, him, and Keenan played on the same team for an entire semester.

                      Moose
                  </h2>
                  <p>
                      I met Moose in a very similar scenario to Keenan. He was already a member of the college's Overwatch team. At first, I did not know him that well and we were cordial with each other. When Connor started the Minecraft server in 2021, we started to grow closer. In 2022, we started hanging out more.
