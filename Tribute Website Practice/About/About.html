            As stated above, this website's purpose is to act as a practice project for myself, as well as a fun tribute I can make to my friends. 
            Each page is purposefully built for my closest friends. The pages include basic info about who they are, their favorite games, and some of their accomplishments. 
            One thing to remember with this website is that it is not entirely serious. Meaning there is a mix of seriousness and goofy behavior.
             I learned about HTML and CSS back when I was in highschool, but I am starting to pick it up again, alongside django and JavaScript. 
             This project was super fun because it required me to relearn a good portion of css, and a little bit of HTML.
             I remebered a lot of HTML, but I did have to learn a bit about the div tag, which was a whole process. Overall, this was a fun project, and I will be adding it to my portfolio
