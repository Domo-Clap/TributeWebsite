Tribute Website For Friends

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a fun little project that I decided to work on as a way to practice some of my HTML and CSS skills. I have not worked with HTML and CSS in around 3-4 years before working on this project, so it was a nice refresher on the topics. I definitely learned more about CSS while working on this project. It also made me understand that Web Devs go through a lot to be able to build such great websites. As for the tribute part, the website revolves around my best friends in life currently. There is Moose, who I have known for 5 years. Austin, who I have known since 2022. Ghosty and Grey, who I met in Early 2023. And Connor, who I met at the start of the pandemic. They are all really good friends and I cherish them deeply. I got to show them this little project and they got some good laughs out of the jokes I included. Overall, it was a fun time to practice HTML/CSS and remember some moments with my friends.

I worked on this project in VS Code, which made it very easy to test and debug any problems I had with the HTML/CSS. It took me around 2 days, with a fews hours of work each day to implement everything I wanted. There is definitely a ton of room for improvement, but I am happy with how it turned out. I really like the card feature that I was able to get working. I did have to do some research on it, but I thought it turned out really cool!

So, if you wanted to run this locally on your machine, you would just need to have VS Code installed, where you can then run/debug this code in a web browser.
